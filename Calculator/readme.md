# Calculator
## 🎯 Objective:
The goal is to design a fundamental calculator using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. This calculator should include buttons for performing basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 🧮

## 🖥️ Screen Display:
Your calculator must feature a screen that displays both the user's inputs and the results of computations. This display will allow users to track their calculations and see the output clearly. 💻

## 🔲 Button Layout:
To organize the buttons neatly, use the CSS grid system to create a structured layout. This ensures that the buttons for each operation are arranged in an easy-to-use interface for a smooth user experience. 📊

## 🖱️ Event Handling:
You’ll need to implement event listeners to capture user input when they click buttons. The program should use conditional statements (if-else) to handle different operations based on the user’s selection, allowing for the correct action to be performed for each button click. 👆

## ➗ Mathematical Operations:
The calculator must handle basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Use operators like (+, -, *, /) to perform these calculations effectively. 🔢

## 🔄 Logic and Flow:
In order to manage the inputs and calculations efficiently, you’ll need to use loops, conditionals, and other logic structures. This will allow the calculator to process the user’s input correctly and display the appropriate results based on the selected operation. ⚙️
