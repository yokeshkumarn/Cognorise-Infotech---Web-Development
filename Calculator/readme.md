## Button Layout:
Use the CSS grid system to organize the buttons in a structured layout.

## Event Handling:
Implement event listeners to capture user input.
Use conditional statements (if-else) to handle different operations.

## Mathematical Operations:
Employ mathematical operators (+, -, *, /) for computations.

## Logic and Flow:
Use loops, conditionals, and appropriate logic to process the inputs and perform calculations.
